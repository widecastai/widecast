# WideCast — Blog / Article Writing

> **If you are an AI assistant** being asked to write a blog post or article

> said the word "WideCast"): read this method end-to-end BEFORE drafting.
> **Skipping = weaker output.** No exception. The method is vendor-neutral

You write **written content that earns the read and the rank**: a person finds
it useful enough to finish and share, and a search engine finds it trustworthy
enough to surface. This skill aligns with what WideCast's content engine rewards
(value density, credibility, specificity, humble expert voice) plus modern SEO
and E-E-A-T practice. A WideCast blog can also be **repurposed into a video** via
`source="blog"`, so write it self-contained and value-dense.

## When to use
- The user asks for a blog post, article, guide, or long-form written content.
- The user gives a topic, research notes, or a transcript to turn into an article.
- Before calling `create_video` with `source="blog"` (the article → a video).

## What a WideCast-grade blog is
- **One clear promise**, delivered. The reader leaves with something they can use.
- **Specific, credible, scannable.** Numbers and concrete examples, honestly
  sourced; short paragraphs and subheads so it can be skimmed.
- **Humble authority.** Show experience; never declare "I'm an expert."
- **Search-aligned but human-first.** Written for a person, structured for a crawler.

## The method

### 1 — Intent + audience + angle
Identify the **search intent** (informational / how-to / comparison / decision)
and the **one angle** that makes this piece different. Write the promise in a
sentence: *"After reading, [who] will be able to [outcome] because [the angle]."*

**Infer this — don't interrogate the user.** The topic usually implies the reader,
the intent, and the goal (real estate → buyers/sellers researching a decision; a
news topic → readers who want what-happened-and-why). **Don't ask obvious
questions** like "who's the audience?". Ask back **only** if something essential is
genuinely missing/ambiguous and would change the article — a bare acronym, two
unrelated meanings, an unnamed "my product/brand" — then **one short batched
question (1–2 max)**. Don't stall on what you can infer; don't silently guess past
a real blocker.

### 2 — Title (the on-page hook)
Apply the same 3-layer logic as a video hook, compressed into a headline:
- **Identity + curiosity + reward**, with a **number or concrete specific** and
  the **primary keyword** worked in naturally.
- ✅ "The 4,200-dollar subscription mistake most people make for a decade"
- ❌ "A guide to saving money" (vague, no stakes, banned-style).
- Avoid "the complete guide", "everything you need to know", clickbait.

### 3 — Intro (first 2–3 sentences = the hook)
Open with the **3-Layer Hook** (Identity → Curiosity tension → Reward signal). No
"In this article we'll…", no throat-clearing. State the stakes, hint the payoff,
and tell the reader what they'll be able to do — without giving away the *how*.

### 4 — Structure (skimmable + logical)
- **H2 sections, one idea each**; H3 for sub-steps. A subhead roughly every
  **150–250 words** so the page is skimmable.
- Pick the shape by intent: **how-to** → numbered steps; **listicle** → numbered
  points; **explainer/comparison** → problem → mechanism → options → recommendation.
- Each section should land an **"aha"** — a takeaway the reader could quote.

### 5 — Body craft
- **Specificity wins:** real numbers, names, costs, timeframes. Include relevant
  **stats/data** — they build trust — and **fact-check before stating** anything.
- Use **precise technical terms** where they add authority, with a one-line plain
  gloss so non-experts keep up.
- **Examples / mini case studies** make abstract points concrete.
- **Credibility honesty (0.0–1.0, be conservative):** verifiable fact 0.9–1.0;
  industry standard 0.7–0.8; common-but-varies 0.5–0.6; vague/"they say" ≤0.4.
  Below ~0.7, soften ("often", "many studies suggest") or cut. Never invent stats.

### 6 — Scannability + formatting
Short paragraphs (≤3–4 lines). **Bold** the load-bearing phrase in key spots.
Bullets/numbered lists for series. One idea per sentence where possible. White
space is a feature.

### 7 — SEO (human-first)
- **Primary keyword** in the title/H1, the intro, at least one H2, and naturally
  through the body — never stuffed. Add **semantic variants** and related terms.
- Write a **meta description** (~150–160 chars) that is itself a mini-hook.
- Note where **internal links** (related content) and **external citations**
  (authoritative sources) should go.
- Match content language; for Vietnamese use proper diacritics.

### 8 — Length tier (pick by intent)
| Tier | Words | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Quick answer | 300–600 | a single question, news, definition |
| Standard | 800–1,200 | most how-to / explainer posts |
| Deep dive | 1,500–2,500 | comprehensive topic, comparison |
| Pillar | 2,500–3,200 | cornerstone / authority page |

(WideCast's engine supports up to ~3,200 words; enforce the chosen range as a
hard target — pad nothing, cut ruthlessly.)

### 9 — Conclusion + CTA
Summarize the value in 2–3 lines (don't just repeat), then **one clear next step**
(read the related piece, try the first tactic, grab the resource). One ask.

## Voice
Humble, second-person, conversational-but-precise. Personal **"I"** for opinion/
experience or company **"We"** for brand — pick one and stay consistent. Like a
knowledgeable friend, not a textbook or a salesperson.

## Anti-fluff pass
Cut "actually, basically, really, very, just, in order to, the fact that", and any
sentence that doesn't advance the promise. If a paragraph has no takeaway, it's
filler — delete or merge.

## Pre-flight checklist
- [ ] Title has a specific + keyword + curiosity; not banned-style/clickbait.
- [ ] Intro is a real hook (stakes + payoff), no "in this article".
- [ ] One clear promise, delivered; each H2 lands an "aha".
- [ ] Stats are fact-checked + honestly framed (≥0.7) or softened/cut.
- [ ] Skimmable: short paragraphs, subheads every ~150–250 words, lists where apt.
- [ ] Keyword in title/intro/≥1 H2 + meta description written.
- [ ] In the chosen length tier; no padding.
- [ ] One CTA at the end.

## Repurpose to video (WideCast)
A finished blog can become a video: call `create_video` with `source="blog"`,
`blog_text=<the article>` (WideCast accepts **30–3,000 words**; >3,000 is
auto-truncated). WideCast condenses it into a narration and builds scenes. So:
keep the article **self-contained** (don't rely on images/links to carry meaning)
and **front-load the value** — the engine rewards the same hook→points→CTA shape.
Pick `output_type="text"` to review the generated script first, or `"video"` to
render the MP4.

## Images (inline, optional)
WideCast can place a real photo next to the paragraph that mentions it: **embed a
direct image file URL inline** in the article text, right beside the sentence it
illustrates — WideCast matches it to that section. **Prefer markdown image
syntax** `![brief description](https://…)` over a bare URL — chat hosts
(Claude / ChatGPT / Grok / Gemini) render the picture inline so the user can
see whether the image fits before approving the draft. The alt text doubles as
the strongest possible scene anchor. Raw URLs still work for backward compat.
For a **real/current-event** article, research with web search and **harvest
STABLE, DIRECT image URLs** (Wikimedia "Original file", official/agency pages,
reputable CDNs) that end in **`.jpg`/`.jpeg`/`.png` ONLY** (no `.gif`/`.webp`/`.svg`/`.bmp`/`.avif`/`.ico`/`.tiff`
— they don't render reliably in our pipeline; a `?query` suffix is fine).
**Verify each is a direct file link, not a page URL, and NEVER fabricate one** — a dead
link just drops the image. No suitable real URL → leave it; WideCast still
illustrates the rest. (Same discipline as the video-script Skill's *Research
first — harvest real visuals* image-sourcing ladder: Wikimedia → the subject's
own authoritative source → reputable secondary via `web_fetch` →
specialty/permissive → auto-B-roll; verify, never fabricate.)

## Output format
Deliver the article in clean Markdown (title as H1, H2/H3 sections, lists, bold).
Offer the meta description separately. Don't include SEO notes inline unless the
user is technical and asks.
